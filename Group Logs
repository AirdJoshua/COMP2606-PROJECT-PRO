23/2/2021
Meeting of goup members to discuss the functional and non functional elements of Stream IO.

Problem Definition 
In the most recent of times, streaming services having been on the rise. From Netflix to Disney+, more and more people are subscribing to streaming services, more and more services are coming out yearly. 
Individuals who are subscribed to more than one service might feel overwhelmed with the amount of content to watch and the different applications to naviagte.
As a person who owns Disney+ and Netflix I find it tedious to switch from application to application. I would prefer if all the content were in one area to navigate through. 
This is the goal of Stream IO, to gather all your accounts from various streaming services and combine them into one application.

GOALS OF SYSTEM AND AIM 
The overall goal of StreamIO is to make the user life easier when it comes to choosing content. 
The goal of Innovators to design whole software, which fulfils all the requirements of customer.
We aim to make to make a system that is easy to use and understand and allows for customization.


Users 
•    Individuals who own more than one streaming service
•    Individual who are interested into getting a bundle of streaming services at a discounted price. 

Non-user: 
•    Streaming service companies
